# Template for TypeScript-based Electron Apps for Visual Studio Code

Template for Electron apps written in TypeScript using Visual Studio Code. It's based on Damien Guard's [electron-typescript-vscode](https://github.com/damieng/electron-typescript-vscode) template. I just made the following adjustments:
* added electron as app dependency in package.json
* updated versions of electron and typescript dependencies in package.json
* using only main.ts with basic instructions from [Electron Blog](https://electronjs.org/blog/typescript)

## Prerequisites

* nodejs and npm
* Visual Studio Code

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bahnson/electron-app-template-for-vscode
npm install
npm start
```
